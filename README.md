StyloScope is a Python-based machine learning application designed to act as a virtual wardrobe stylist. It applies supervised
 learning models trained on CSV datasets to recommend outfit combinations based on attributes such as clothing type, color,
 style, occasion, season, and body type. The system includes a Tkinter interface for wardrobe registration and integrates
 feature encoding with scikit-learn to ensure accurate, personalized recommendations.
